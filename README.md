use your favorite mono injector. [sharpmonoinjector](https://github.com/warbler/SharpMonoInjector) is great

Namespace: RoRCheats

Class: Loader

Method: Load

I can't get unload to be reliable, since Sharpmonoinjector seems to have issues with the new unity. usually you'd call the Unload method on the loader class to unload it.
